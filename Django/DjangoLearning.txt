Django: 
    it is a python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using python
    django take care of difficult stuff so that you can concentrate on building your web applications
    djano emphasizes reusability of components also referred to as DRY(Dont repeat yourself) and comes with ready to use features like login system,  db connection and CRUD operations

how does Django work?
    Django will follow MVT design pattern
        Model: the data you want to present usually data from a database
        View: a request handler that returns the relevent template and content - based on request from the user.
        Template : A text file(like a html file) contains the layout of webpage with logic on how to display data.

    
    MODEL: model provides data from database. the models are usually located in models.py
        -the data is delivered as an ORM(object relational mapping) which is a technique designed to make it 
         easier to work with database.
        -the most common way to extract data from db is SQL.
        -Django with ORM makes it easier to communicate with db without having to write complex SQL statements.

    View:the views are usually located in views.py
            A view is a function or method that keeps http request as argument,
            imports the relevant models and finds out what data to send to template 
            and returns the final result.

    Template: the template of an application is located in folder names templates.
        it is a file where we can describe how the result should be represented.
        templates are mostly in html code describing the layout of webpage.
        Django uses standard HTML to describe the layout. but uses Django tags to add logic 
            <h1> My home </h1>
            <p> my name is {{first name}} </p>
